### Introduction to Activities
---
An `Activity` provides the window which your apps draws its UI. Typically, an `Activity` takes up the whole screen of your running app. Every app has one or more activites.

The top-level or first activity is often called the `MainActivity` and is provided by the project template.

For more complicated apps, there may be multiple screens and more than one activity. Each activity has a specific purpose.

For example, in photo gallery app, you could use `Activity` for displaying a grid of photos, a second `Activity` for viewing an individual photo and, third `Acitivity` for editing individual photo.
